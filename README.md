Binary Search: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach

Binary search, a cornerstone of efficient searching algorithms, employs the divide-and-conquer strategy to locate an element within a sorted array. It recursively divides the array in half, comparing the target element to the midpoint element, and eliminating half of the array with each iteration. This technique significantly reduces the number of comparisons required, making it remarkably efficient for large datasets.

Bubble Sort: A Simple Yet Effective Sorting Algorithm

Bubble sort, a straightforward yet effective sorting algorithm, repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process iterates until the array is sorted. While bubble sort is not the most efficient algorithm, its simplicity and ease of implementation make it a valuable tool for beginners.

Bubble Sort in Decreasing Order: Reversing the Sorting Order

Bubble sort can be modified to sort an array in decreasing order by simply reversing the comparison condition. Instead of swapping elements when the left element is greater than the right element, swap them when the left element is less than the right element. This minor modification transforms bubble sort into a versatile sorting algorithm capable of handling both ascending and descending order.

Counting Duplicates with Binary Search: Efficient Duplicate Detection

Binary search can be effectively utilized to count the number of duplicate elements in a sorted array. By performing binary searches on the occurrences of each unique element, the total count of duplicates can be accurately determined. This approach proves particularly useful for large datasets where traditional counting methods may become inefficient.

Counting Ones with Binary Search: Finding Specific Elements

Binary search can also be employed to efficiently count the number of occurrences of a specific element, such as '1', within a sorted binary array. By identifying the first and last occurrences of '1' using binary search, the total count can be determined with precision. This technique is particularly useful in applications involving binary data manipulation.

Insertion Sort: Incrementally Building a Sorted Array

Insertion sort, another fundamental sorting algorithm, incrementally builds a sorted array by inserting each element into its correct position. It iterates through the unsorted portion of the array, comparing each element to the sorted subarray and shifting elements to accommodate the new insertion. Insertion sort is known for its stable nature, preserving the original order of equal elements.

Insertion Sort in Decreasing Order: Reversing the Insertion Order

Similar to bubble sort, insertion sort can be modified to sort an array in decreasing order by reversing the insertion condition. Instead of inserting elements into their ascending order, insert them into their descending order. This subtle change transforms insertion sort into a versatile sorting algorithm capable of handling both ascending and descending order.

Last Occurrence: Finding the Rightmost Instance

The concept of last occurrence involves identifying the rightmost position where a target element appears in a sorted array. While linear search can be used to find the last occurrence, binary search offers a more efficient approach. By recursively narrowing down the search range, binary search can quickly locate the last occurrence with minimal comparisons.

Linear Search: A Simple Sequential Search Algorithm

Linear search, a fundamental searching algorithm, systematically scans through a list, comparing each element to the target element until a match is found or the list is exhausted. While linear search is straightforward, its efficiency diminishes for large datasets.

Lower Occurrence: Finding the Leftmost Instance

Lower occurrence refers to identifying the leftmost position where a target element appears in a sorted array. Unlike last occurrence, linear search is more appropriate for finding the lower occurrence since it can terminate as soon as a match is encountered. Binary search, however, requires additional processing to locate the exact leftmost position.

Selection Sort: Repeatedly Selecting the Minimum Element

Selection sort, a comparison-based sorting algorithm, repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it in its correct position in the sorted subarray. This process iterates until the entire array is sorted. While selection sort is relatively simple, its efficiency is lower compared to other sorting algorithms.

Selection Sort in Decreasing Order: Selecting the Maximum Element

Selection sort can be modified to sort an array in decreasing order by selecting the maximum element instead of the minimum element. This straightforward modification transforms selection sort into a versatile sorting algorithm capable of handling both ascending and descending order.

Square Root Using Binary Search: Approximating Square Root

Binary search can be ingeniously employed to approximate the square root of a non-negative number. By iteratively refining the search range, binary search can converge to a value that is very close
